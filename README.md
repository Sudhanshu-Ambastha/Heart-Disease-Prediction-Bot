## About

The Heart Disease Prediction project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning models. The project includes various files and models designed for heart disease prediction.

## Files

1. **Heart disease completed.py (working main model):** This file contains the primary code for the heart disease prediction model.
2. **Heart disease prediction with pictoblox.sb3:** A version of the heart disease prediction model implemented in PictoBlox, a visual programming language.
3. **Heart disease prediction with spyder.py (same as google collab file but just a Spyder version):** A Spyder version of the code for heart disease prediction.
4. **Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv:** A dataset used for improving prediction scores.
5. **heart.csv:** A dataset used for heart disease prediction.
6. **heart_disease_data.csv:** Another dataset used in the project.
7. **heart_disease_prediction.py (Google Colab file):** A Google Colab version of the heart disease prediction model.

## Features

- Utilizes three different CSV datasets to improve prediction scores.
- Trained on a logistic regression model.
- Provides a PictoBlox version for educational purposes and ease of understanding.

## Usage

To use the Heart Disease Prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Choose the appropriate file for your needs: "Heart disease completed.py," "Heart disease prediction with spyder.py," or "heart_disease_prediction.py."
2. Ensure that you have the required datasets: "Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv," "heart.csv," and "heart_disease_data.csv."
3. Run the code to predict heart disease based on the provided dataset.
